# Slide-Show - an Image Carousel clone


Use the slide-show class attached to a div to activate the scroller object
Include image elements inside the div to fill the scroller object
The order the images are in will be the order they appear in the scroller object
Use data-slide-show-delay to set the time to show each image in ms, defaults to 5000ms
Use data-slide-show-direction to set the direction the scroller rotates, can be right or left, defaults to right
Use data-slide-show-fill can be set to "fill", which will fill each image to the size of whatever element is wrapping the .slide-show.  Otherwise, the images will be set to the height of the smallest image, and a margin will be left if the image is narrower than the .slide-show.
